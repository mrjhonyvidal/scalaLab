### Specific design patterns for Scala that will be adding examples: 

#### Design Pattern
A reusable solution to a common recurring problem.
So first of all we need to be possible to identify the problem scenario.

- Typeclass Pattern: Achieving Abstraction
- Cake Pattern: for Dependency Injection
- Lazy Evaluation Pattern: for Optimizing Performance
- Lens Pattern: for Overcoming Immutability Limitations
- Implicits Injection Pattern: for Dependency Injection
- Memoization Pattern

#### Advantages
 - code reuse
 - code extensibility
 - code modifiability.
Purpose:
    - object creation(Creational)
    - class/object composition(Structural)
    - object interaction(Behavioral)

#### Scope of design pattern, where it's applied?
- Class
Compile time, cannot change on runtime.
Example, Factory method pattern.

- Runtime objects
Apply during runtime and relationship between objects, and can be changed during runtime.

- Applied on a Functional way
By using functional constructs
